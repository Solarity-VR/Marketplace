        <span>The for profit DAO is where the users go, and where the transactions happen. That DAO will use their land as a service,
        but who actually manages that DAO is mutiple non profit DAOs of developers and creators that worked on that. 
        So they are the one actually managing all the treasury of the for profit metaverse all done automatically with the Goldberg
        Governance.</span>
